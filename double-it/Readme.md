Problem Statement

Write a program that asks a user to enter a number. Your program will then double that number and print out the result. It will repeat that process until the value is 100 or greater.

For example if the user enters the number 2 you would then print:

4 8 16 32 64 128

Note that:

2 doubled is 4

4 doubled is 8

8 doubled is 16

and so on.

We stop at 128 because that value is greater than 100.
